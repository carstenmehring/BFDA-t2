These studies have used a Bayes factor (BF) analysis and might be used as examples. Please note: We did not review the provided code or the papers, and this list is not to be meant as an endorsement. Please use with care.

A list of "official" examples for the usage of the BFDA package can be found in our [manual](https://rawgit.com/nicebread/BFDA/master/package/doc/BFDA_manual.html) and in the [supplemental material](https://osf.io/3f5qd/) of our [tutorial paper](https://psyarxiv.com/aqr79/).
